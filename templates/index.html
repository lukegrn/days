	Days is a photo project that will begin in 2026 and continue for the
	full year in which I take at least one picture every day, and upload
	one to this site. The purpose of this is two-fold:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Encourage me to shoot more</li>
	<li>Document daily life in its mundanity as well as its exceptionality</li>
</ol>
